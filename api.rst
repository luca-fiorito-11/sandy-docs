Ptyhon API for nuclear data files
*********************************

SANDY includes a Python API that allows parsing formatted files, analyzing and performing a series 
of operations on different nuclear data types.
Cross sections, neutron multiplicities, angular and energy ditributions, fission yields and the 
respective covariance data can be stored in user-friedly ``pandas.DataFrame``.
Each dataframe is customized to provide additional functions that are inherent to each 
specific data type.

The Python API documentation is available `here <https://luca-fiorito-11.github.io/sandy>`_.
